The Battle Ship Game
=

Battle Ship is a game played by both players setting up his/her ship at a certain coordinate. This ship is two 'blocks'
long and can either be placed vertically or horizontally. The other player, in this case a custom AI, guesses to try and
locate the other players ship. Once the player has located one of the other's ship 'blocks', he must find the second. The
second 'block' could be on any of the first 'block's 4 sides. The AI knows this, and will use this information.

HINTS:
=
- Guessing the same coordinate twice will lose you a turn.
- Always guess around the first 'block'.
- The AI doesn't have a guessing pattern (though this is planned). Use this to your advantage.
